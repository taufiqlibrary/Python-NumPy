    "\n",
    "All arrays have a property called .shape that returns a tuple of the size in each dimension. It’s less important which dimension is which, but it’s critical that the arrays you pass to functions are in the shape that the functions expect. A common way to confirm that your data has the proper shape is to print the data and its shape until you’re sure everything is working like you expect.\n",

    "Here, you use a numpy.ndarray method called .reshape() to form a 2 × 2 × 3 block of data. When you check the shape of your array in input 3, it’s exactly what you told it to be. However, you can see how printed arrays quickly become hard to visualize in three or more dimensions. After you swap axes with .swapaxes(), it becomes little clearer which dimension is which. You’ll see more about axes in the next section.\n",
