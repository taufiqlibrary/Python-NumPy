    "That wraps up a section that was heavy in theory but a little light on practical, real-world examples. In this section, you’ll work through some examples of real, useful data science operations: filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.\n",

    "## Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing uses many of the same idioms that normal Python code uses. You can use positive or negative indices to index from the front or back of the array. You can use a colon (:) to specify “the rest” or “all,” and you can even use two colons to skip elements as with regular Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the difference: NumPy arrays use commas between axes, so you can index multiple axes in one set of square brackets. An example is the easiest way to show this off. It’s time to confirm Dürer’s magic square!\n",
    "\n",
    "The number square below has some amazing properties. If you add up any of the rows, columns, or diagonals, then you’ll get the same number, 34. That’s also what you’ll get if you add up each of the four quadrants, the center four squares, the four corner squares, or the four corner squares of any of the contained 3 × 3 grids. You’re going to prove it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fun fact: In the bottom row, the numbers 15 and 14 are in the middle, representing the year that Dürer created this square. The numbers 1 and 4 are also in that row, representing the first and fourth letters of the alphabet, A and D, which are the initials of the square’s creator, Albrecht Dürer!\n",
